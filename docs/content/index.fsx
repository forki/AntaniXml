AntaniXml is a .NET library for generating random xml based on a schema.

This is useful mainly for testing, especially to produce stress test data, 
but also for unit and property based testing.
Of course generating samples may also help in figuring out concretely what 
kind of xml is defined by a certain schema.

<div class="row">
  <div class="span1"></div>
  <div class="span6">
    <div class="well well-small" id="nuget">
      The library can be <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/AntaniXml">installed from NuGet</a>:
      <pre>PM> Install-Package AntaniXml</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="span1"></div>
</div>

AntaniXml is developed in [F#](http://fsharp.org) but the public API should be usable also from C#.
In fact many examples are given in both languages.

Example
-------

The first example is straightforward, just obtain a generator from a factory method, 
specifying the xsd file and the element definition within the schema to use as a template.
Then call the `Generate` method to get the desired number of samples:

*)
#r "AntaniXml.dll"
open AntaniXml

let samples = 
    XmlElementGenerator
        .CreateFromSchemaUri("po.xsd", elmName = "purchaseOrder", elmNs = "")
        .Generate(10)

(**

The C# code is almost the same:

    var samples = XmlElementGenerator
        .CreateFromSchemaUri("po.xsd", elmName: "purchaseOrder", elmNs: "")
        .Generate(10);


Notice that in both languages to enhance readability we used named arguments for the element name and namespace.


There is also a `GenerateInfinite` method allowing never ending sequences of random xml to be created on demand.
This may be handy for stress testing so that you don't have to produce and store up-front huge amounts of data.
